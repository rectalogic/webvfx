QML is more interesting as a video effects technology when it
is extended with
<a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qt-quick3d-snapshot/index.html">QtQuick3D</a>.

Textured 3D scenes can be modeled in a tool like
<a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>.
This can be exported as a Wavefront *.obj file which
the QtQuick3D asset importer can load.
Then frames of video can be applied as textures to named pieces of the model,
while the camera view is animated for the duration of the effect.

If your QML imports the @c org.webvfx.WebVfx namespace, this will
make available some additional useful QML elements.
@code
import org.webvfx.WebVfx 1.0
@endcode

@li @c AnimatedCamera - this is a @c <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qt-quick3d-snapshot/qml-camera.html">Camera</a>
  that supports an additional @c animationData property.
  This property should be set to the JSON camera path data exported
  by the Blender addon in @c tools/blender/webvfx-camera.py
@li @c TextTexture - this is a @c <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/qml-text.html">Text</a>
  element that renders itself to an image which can then be used
  as a 3D texture. The texture image is accessed using the @c textureImage
  property.

See @ref examples/transition-demo3d.qml "demo/examples/transition-demo3d.qml"
for an example.
