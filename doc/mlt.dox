@page mlt MLT Plugins

%WebVfx implements producer, filter and transition plugin services for the
<a href="http://www.mltframework.org/">MLT Framework</a>.
The MLT service ID is @c webvfx and the service argument
or @c resource property is the path to the HTML or QML effect implementation.

MLT services are implemented as %WebVfx effects - see @ref effects_authoring.
The pathname to the HTML or QML effects implementation can be provided
as the service contructor argument, or specified using the @c resource
property. e.g.
@code
melt -transition webvfx:/path/to/transition.html
@endcode
@code
melt -transition webvfx resource=/path/to/transition.html
@endcode

@section mlt_extra Extra Images

Effects that use extra images (i.e. that register @c webvfx.ExtraImageType
image names) accept an additional set of attributes of the form:
<b>producer.</b><em>name</em><b>.</b><em>producer_attribute</em>.
@li @em name - Name of the extra image. This is the name that was
    tagged with @c webvfx.ExtraImageType.
@li @em producer_attribute - Any valid producer attribute.
    At a minimum the @c resource attribute must be specified.
    @c in and @c out can also be specified (e.g. to extract a single
    frame from a video). e.g. for an extra image named @c "foobar"
    we might have:
@code
producer.foobar.resource=/some/file.mov
producer.foobar.in=90
producer.foobar.out=200
@endcode

The example
@ref examples/transition-demo.html "demo/examples/transition-demo.html"
transition uses an
extra image named @c "backgroundImage":
@dontinclude transition-demo.html
@skip webvfx.imageTypeMap
@until };

The melt script example demo/mlt/mlt_transition_demo_html specifies
the @c producer.backgroundImage.resource attribute for the transition:
@include mlt_transition_demo_html

@section mlt_demos Demos

A set of bash scripts are provided to run @em melt with the sample
effects. These are located in the @c demo/mlt directory and should
be run in that directory.
They are configurable through @c VFX_ prefixed environment variables.
e.g. to run the @c mlt_transition_demo_html script, you can change
the default source and target videos using @c VFX_SOURCE and @c VFX_TARGET.
@code
VFX_SOURCE=/videos/source.mov VFX_TARGET=/videos/target.mov ./mlt_transition_demo_html
@endcode
The demos default to using the SDL consumer, this can be changed to the avformat
consumer by setting @c VFX_CONSUMER=consumer_av and setting @c VFX_OUTPUT
to the path of the output QuickTime movie file to be created.

@htmlonly
Each of the demos has been rendered as a video and can be previewed
from the corresponding <a href="examples.html">example</a>.
