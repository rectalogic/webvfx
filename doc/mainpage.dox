%WebVfx is a video effects framework that allows video effects
(filters, transitions etc.) to be authored using
<a href="http://qt.nokia.com/qtquick/">QtQuick</a>
QML (a declarative CSS and JavaScript like language).
See @ref effects_authoring for documentation and samples.

%WebVfx includes plugins for the
<a href="http://www.mltframework.org/">MLT</a>
open source multimedia framework.
See @ref mlt for information on how to use %WebVfx with MLT.

rendered using them with MLT can be viewed here:
